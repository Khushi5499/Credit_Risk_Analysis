# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Machine Learning project to predict loan default using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.


# Credit Risk Analysis Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes credit risk using a combination of **SQL-based data analysis** and **Machine Learning** models. The goal is to predict loan default risk and identify key factors influencing loan defaults. The project leverages SQL for data manipulation and exploration, and machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## 🏆 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and categorical data  
   - Created dummy variables for `employment_status`  

2. **SQL Analysis:**  
   - Explored loan data using complex queries  
   - Identified key patterns in loan defaults  

3. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - Built and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, AUC, and other metrics
  
# 📊 ** SQL Questions**  

1. **Check total records loaded**  
2. **View first 10 records**  
3. **Check default vs. non-default customers**  
4. **Find customers with low credit scores (Risky borrowers)**  
5. **Find average loan amount by employment status**  
6. **Find the Top 5 Highest Loan Amounts with Customer Details**  
7. **Find the Average Interest Rate and Loan Duration for Each Employment Status**  
8. **Find Customers with High Debt-to-Income Ratio and Low Credit Score**  
9. **Count the Number of Defaults by Age Group**  
10. **Find the Percentage of Default Cases by Employment Status**  
11. **Identify the Top 3 Customers with the Highest Late Payments**  
12. **Find the Total Loan Amount Approved vs Defaulted**  
13. **Find the Correlation Between Credit Score and Interest Rate**  
14. **Find the Average Number of Late Payments for Each Loan Status**  
15. **Find Customers with High Loan Amounts but Low Credit Scores**

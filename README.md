# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Machine Learning project to predict loan default using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.


# Credit Risk Analysis Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes credit risk using a combination of **SQL-based data analysis** and **Machine Learning** models. The goal is to predict loan default risk and identify key factors influencing loan defaults. The project leverages SQL for data manipulation and exploration, and machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## 🏆 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and categorical data  
   - Created dummy variables for `employment_status`  

2. **SQL Analysis:**  
   - Explored loan data using complex queries  
   - Identified key patterns in loan defaults  

3. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - Built and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, AUC, and other metrics
  
4. **Questions used in SQL:**
